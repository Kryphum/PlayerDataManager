# PlayerDataManager
This is a plugin for PocketMine servers that is really just a small API for developers to store data in a central place throughout the server. PDM allows "registering" players as instances of `PDMPlayer` and adding "properties" (`PDMProperty`) to them. You can then access PDM from any plugin and fetch any property from any player.
